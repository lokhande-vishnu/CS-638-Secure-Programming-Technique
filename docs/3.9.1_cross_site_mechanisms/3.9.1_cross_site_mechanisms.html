				This exercise covers two important vulnerabilities: Cross Site Scripting and Cross Site Request Forgery. Both of these fall into the category of "Cross Site Mechanisms" because they abuse vulnerabilities in websites to target a user's browser. In the case of Cross Site Scripting, an attacker is able to execute scripts in the victim's browser. With Cross Site Request Forgery, an attacker can trick a user's browser into sending an authenticated request crafted by the attacker. These are called cross site mechanisms because they almost always involve an adversarial web site and the vulnerable web site. As you will see, simply clicking a link on an attacker's webpage or even just visiting one can trigger this attack.

			<h3>Cross Site Scripting</h3>
			<p>
				In the first exercise, your objective is to exploit a cross site scripting vulnerability to inject a script into a vulnerable web page. See the <a href="3.9.1_cross_site_scripting.html">cross site scripting exercise</a> for full instructions.
			</p>

			<h3>Cross Site Request Forgery</h3>
			<p>
				In the second exercise, your objective is to exploit a cross site request forgery vulnerability to trick a victim's browser to trigger an authenticated action on a vulnerable server. See the <a href="3.9.1_cross_site_request_forgery.html"> cross site request forgery exercise </a> for full instructions.
